<h2><u>Computer</h2></u>
<a href="#top">Go to top</a>
<p>a computer is ageneral purpose device that can be programmed to carry a set of arithemetic or logical operations.Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed,the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.</p>
<h3 id="cpu">cpu</h3>
<p>a cntral processing unit (CPU) also referred as a central processor unit is the hardware within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithemetical,logical,and input output operations of the system.The term has been used in the computer industry atleast at the early 1960's.The form,design and implementation of cpu's have changed over the course of the history,but their fundamental operations still remai the same</p>
<h3 id="ALU">ALU</H3>
	<p>In computing an arithemetic and logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit that performs integer arithemetic and logical operations.The ALU is a fundamental building block of a cental processing unit of a computer and even the simplest microprocessors contain one for purposes such as maintaining timers.The processors found inside modern CPU's and graphic ptocessing unit(GPU'S) accomadate very powerful and avery complex ALU's a single component may contain number of ALU's</p>
